     I'm <b>Zeel</b>, a curious and creative soul currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Computer Science at <mark>Codinggita</mark>. I love remixing code with design, and I believe that <i>every line of HTML can tell a story</i>. Whether it’s debugging C programs or crafting Instagram aesthetics, I’m always chasing that perfect blend of logic and vibe.

    Outside the classroom, you’ll find me <b>curating music</b>, designing <i>Instagram covers</i>, and experimenting with <mark>Figma layouts</mark>. I’m passionate about <sup>caption crafting</sup>, <sub>mobile photography</sub>, and creating reels that feel both playful and poetic. I also love casual gaming and tech journaling — anything that lets me express myself and connect meaningfully.

    My goal? To build a portfolio that’s not just technically sound but emotionally resonant. I want to master semantic HTML, CSS, and beginner-friendly coding practices while designing interfaces that feel intuitive and alive. Someday, I hope to inspire others to see code as a canvas — not just a tool.
